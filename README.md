# Data Transformation 

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced data transformation techniques on a sample employee dataset. The core objective is to clean, enhance, and enrich employee records by applying string manipulations, date-time handling, role deduplication, and categorization â€” resulting in a structured and insightful Excel report.


# Key Transformations

- **Name Construction:** Combined `first_name` and `last_name` into a new `full_name`.
- **Date-Time Handling:**
  - Converted `date` to datetime format.
  - Extracted day name (e.g., Monday) and formatted time (`HH:MM:SS`).
  - Calculated `working_days` from hire date to the current date.
- **String Processing on Job Titles:**
  - Extracted `job_prefix` (first 3 letters) and `job_suffix` (last 3 letters).
- **Duplicate Role Detection:**
  - Marked duplicate job titles and generated a `unique_role_key` for each.
- **Role Categorization:**
  - Mapped job titles to broader categories (e.g., Engineering, Management, Support).
- **Excel Reporting:**
  - Exported the final dataset to a professional Excel file using `pandas` and `openpyxl`.
